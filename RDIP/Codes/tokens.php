Step - 1: Click on the experiment tab.

Step - 2: You get a dropdown with Corpus 1, 2 and 3 as the options.

Step - 3: Let us select Corpus 1 from the dropdown.
Step - 4: According to the message, our objective is to enter the correct number of tokens and types from the corpus using the description
 that unique words from the corpus are types and all words are tokens. Let us write the corpus again below and highlight 
 tokens(RED + YELLOW) and types(RED) from the definition.
 Step - 5: If we do not enter 169 and 80 i.e. the count of the types and tokens in the table and the answer is checked 
 the boxes turn red. If the boxes turn red(even one of them), an error message is displayed saying Wrong Answer.

Step - 6: If the answer is correct though(both have to be correct), another button is displayed along with the message 
Right Answer that says Continue, and when that button is clicked, the right answer message and the submit button vanishes. 

Step - 7: They are replaced by the message “Now, consider all the tokens with the same 'root' word to be of the same type.
 Recalculate the number of types.” There is also a box that says, #NewTypes, and a new submit button below this. 

Step - 8: To complete this simulation, we need the right answer for the new types which we get from the concept of stemming. 
This concept is basically a method of reducing any word to its root word, example is found stems from find, boys stems from boy and so on. 
You can find all about stemming here. 
Once you enter a value it tells whether you are right or wrong based on the same RED and GREEN error messages as seen previously.
